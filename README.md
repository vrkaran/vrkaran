# Hi, I’m Karan Vishwakarma 👋  

Founder & early-stage startup operator working at the intersection of **healthcare, nutrition, and technology**.

I build and operate **zero-to-one products**, work closely with domain experts and founders, and focus on **strategy, execution, and system design** in early-stage environments.

- Designing scalable health & nutrition systems
- Translating complex domain problems into product and execution frameworks
- Working with advisors, doctors, and ecosystem partners

## 🛠️ Technical & System Literacy
I use technology as a **tool for execution**, not as an end in itself.

**Languages & Tools**
- Python (working proficiency)
- SQL, APIs, system design fundamentals
- Git, GitHub, Docker, Cloud (AWS / GCP – working exposure)

**AI & Data**
- Applied machine learning & AI concepts

**Product & Ops**
- Product logic & MVP design
- Operations workflows & execution tracking
- Startup experimentation & iteration

## 📂 Selected Work (Repos)
- **AyurGenX Platform** – product architecture, experiments, and documentation  
- **HBX Operations** – operational workflows, pricing logic, and execution learnings  
- **Startup Experiments** – GTM tests, market experiments, and decision logs  
- **AI Experiments** – focused POCs and applied ML demos  

*(Code quality > quantity. Documentation and thinking matter.)*
